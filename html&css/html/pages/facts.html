                                <p>India, like many other countries, has a complex relationship with drugs, encompassing both traditional and contemporary aspects. Here are some key points related to drug culture in India:

                                    <h2 class="danger-heading"> Traditional Drug Use:</h2>
                                    
                                    <p>Ayurveda and Traditional Medicine: India has a rich history of traditional medicine, including Ayurveda, which utilizes various herbs and plants for medicinal purposes. Some of these substances may have psychoactive properties, and their use is often deeply ingrained in cultural and religious practices.
                                    Cannabis Use:
                                    
                                    </p><p class="alert-info"> and Religious Significance: Cannabis has been used in religious rituals in India for centuries. It is associated with Lord Shiva and is commonly consumed during festivals like Holi and Mahashivratri.
                                    Legal Status: The legal status of cannabis is a topic of debate in India. While the recreational use of cannabis is largely illegal, there are some states where the use of marijuana for medicinal and religious purposes is permitted.
                                    Opium and Other Narcotics:
                                </p><p>
                                    Opium Cultivation: India has a history of opium cultivation, and it remains one of the largest legal producers of opium for pharmaceutical purposes. However, illegal cultivation and trafficking of opium and its derivatives also pose significant challenges.
                                    Illicit Drug Trade:
                                </p><p class="alert-info">
                                    Narcotics Trafficking: India faces challenges related to the trafficking of illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine, and synthetic drugs. The country is both a source and a transit point for the illegal drug trade.
                                    Government Initiatives: The government has implemented various measures to combat drug trafficking, including the enforcement of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.
                                    Youth and Substance Abuse:
                                </p><p>
                                    Increasing Concerns: There are growing concerns about substance abuse, especially among the youth, in urban areas. Commonly abused substances include alcohol, tobacco, prescription drugs, and various synthetic drugs.
                                    Government Response:
                                </p><p class="alert-danger">
                                    Legislation and Enforcement: The Indian government has enacted legislation to regulate and control the use of narcotics and psychotropic substances. However, the enforcement of these laws faces challenges due to factors such as corruption, poverty, and limited resources.
                                    Public Awareness and Rehabilitation:
                                </p><p>
                                    Awareness Programs: Various organizations and government agencies work on awareness programs to educate the public about the dangers of drug abuse.
                                    Rehabilitation Centers: There are rehabilitation centers across the country that provide support and treatment for individuals struggling with substance abuse.
                                    International Cooperation:
                                </p><p>
                                    Collaboration with Other Countries: India collaborates with international organizations and other countries to address the global issue of drug trafficking. This includes participation in efforts to combat the production and trafficking of illegal drugs.
                                    It's important to note that drug culture and the challenges associated with it can vary widely across different regions of India, and the situation may evolve over time. Additionally, policies and attitudes toward drug use may change, and new initiatives may be introduced to address emerging issues.

                                <p>Marijuana is one of the most abused drugs in the world. There is an ever-growing gap between the latest science about marijuana and the myths surrounding it. Some people think that since it is legal in some places, it must be safe. But your body doesn’t know a legal drug from an illegal drug. It only knows the effect the drug creates once you have taken it. The purpose of this publication is to clear up some of the misunderstandings about pot.

                                    <h2 class="danger-heading">Marijuana comes from the Indian hemp plant, and the part that contains the “drug” is found primarily in the flowers (commonly called the “buds”) and much less in the seeds, leaves, and stems of the plant.
                                    </h2>
                                    <p>
                                    Marijuana is one of the most abused drugs in the world.
                                    Marijuana, when sold, is a mixture of dried out leaves, stems, flowers and seeds of the hemp plant. It is usually green, brown or gray in color.
                                </p><p class="alert-info">
                                    Hashish is tan, brown or black resin that is dried and pressed into bars, sticks or balls. When smoked, both marijuana and hashish give off a distinctive, sweet odor.
                                    
                                    There are over 400 chemicals in marijuana and hashish.1 The chemical that causes intoxication or the “high” in users is called THC (short for tetrahydrocannabinol). THC creates the mind-altering effects that classifies marijuana as a “drug.”
                                    
                                    Plants, like animals, have traits that protect them in the wild. Plants can have colors or patterns that camouflage them from predators, or they can contain poisons or toxins that, when eaten, make animals sick or alter their mental capacity, putting them at risk in the wild. THC is the protective mechanism of the marijuana plant.
                                </p><p class="alert-danger">
                                    Intoxication literally means “to poison by taking a toxic substance into your body.” Any substance that intoxicates causes changes in the body and the mind. It can create addiction or dependence, causing a person to want to take that drug even if it harms him or her.
                                    
                                    The other thing to know is that burning dried leaves and buds and inhaling the smoke into your lungs is definitely not “natural” and like smoking cigarettes, can be harmful to your body.
                                </p><p class="alert-info"> 
                                    As for the medical uses of marijuana, it contains another chemical called CBD (short for cannabidiol). This is the substance most often associated with creating medical benefits. Unlike THC, CBD does not cause a high.2 Its medical benefits are still being studied, as are methods to breed marijuana plants with high CBD and low THC for medical use.
                                    
                                    Marijuana is a drug like alcohol, cocaine, or ecstasy. And like these other drugs, it has side effects that can be harmful.</p>

                                    <p class="alert-info">   Synthetic drugs are created using man-made chemicals rather than natural ingredients.
                                    </p>
                                    A number of synthetic drugs on the market, including Ecstasy, LSD and methamphetamine, are described in other booklets in The Truth About Drugs series. This booklet gives the facts about “synthetic marijuana” (Spice or K2), “synthetic stimulants” (Bath Salts) and a drug known as “N-bomb.” These are among the synthetic drugs known as “designer drugs.”

                                    <h2 class="danger-heading"> DESIGNER DRUGS — A RISKY EXPERIMENT</h2>
                                    <p class="alert-danger"> 
                                    To understand what synthetic marijuana and Bath Salts are, and how they came to exist, you have to know what a “designer drug” is. A designer drug is a synthetic (chemically made) version of an illegal drug that was slightly altered to avoid having it classified as illegal. It is essentially an experiment by a chemist done to create a new drug that can be sold legally (on the Internet or in stores), allowing dealers to make money without breaking the law. As law enforcement catches up with new chemicals that are so created and makes them illegal, manufacturers devise altered versions to steer clear of the law. So the cycle repeats.

                                    Some of these drugs are sold over the Internet or in certain stores (as “herbal smoking blends”), while others are disguised as products labeled “not for human consumption” (such as “herbal incense,” “plant food,” “bath salts” or “jewelry cleaner”) to mask their intended purpose and avoid health and safety rules.

                                    Due to the constantly growing number of chemicals that are developed, designer drug users have no way of knowing what the drugs they take might contain. Further, as a small modification made to a known drug may result—and often does—in a new drug with greatly different effects, users cannot predict the impact on health from the substances they experiment with.

                                    <p class="alert-info">Alcohol is a drug.
                                    It is classed as a depressant, meaning that it slows down vital functions—resulting in slurred speech, unsteady movement, disturbed perceptions and an inability to react quickly.
                                    </p>
                                    As for how it affects the mind, it is best understood as a drug that reduces a person’s ability to think rationally and distorts his or her judgment.
                                    
                                    Although classified as a depressant, the amount of alcohol consumed determines the type of effect. Most people drink for the stimulant effect, such as a beer or glass of wine taken to “loosen up.” But if a person consumes more than the body can handle, they then experience alcohol’s depressant effect. They start to feel “stupid” or lose coordination and control.
                                    <p class="alert-info">
                                    Alcohol overdose causes even more severe depressant effects (inability to feel pain, toxicity where the body vomits the poison, and finally unconsciousness or, worse, coma or death from severe toxic overdose). These reactions depend on how much is consumed and how quickly.
                                    </p>
                                    There are different kinds of alcohol. Ethyl alcohol (ethanol), the only alcohol used in beverages, is produced by the fermentation of grains and fruits. Fermenting is a chemical process whereby yeast acts upon certain ingredients in the food, creating alcohol.
                                    
                                    <h2 class="danger-heading">ALCOHOL CONTENT</h2>
                                    <p class="alert-danger">Fermented drinks, such as beer and wine, contain from 2% alcohol to 20% alcohol. Distilled drinks, or liquor, contain from 40% to 50% or more alcohol. The usual alcohol content for each is:
                                    
                                    <ul>
                                   <li> Beer - 2–6% alcohol</li>

                                   <li> Wine - 8–20% alcohol</li>
                                   <li> Tequila - 40% alcohol</li>

                                <p class="alert-danger">
                                The word cocaine refers to the drug in a powder form or crystal form.1 The powder is usually mixed with substances such as corn starch, talcum powder and/or sugar or other drugs such as procaine (a local anesthetic) or amphetamines.
                                </p><p>
                                Extracted from coca leaves, cocaine was originally developed as a painkiller. It is most often sniffed, with the powder absorbed into the bloodstream through the nasal tissues. It can also be ingested or rubbed into the gums.
                                    </p><p class="alert-danger">
                                To more rapidly absorb the drug into the body, abusers inject it, but this substantially increases the risk of overdose. Inhaling it as smoke or vapor speeds absorption with less health risk than injection.</p>




                                <h2 class="danger-heading"> A DEADLY WHITE POWDER</h2>
                                <p class="alert-info">Cocaine is one of the most dangerous drugs known to man. Once a person begins taking the drug, it has proven almost impossible to become free of its grip physically and mentally. Physically it stimulates key receptors (nerve endings that sense changes in the body) within the brain that, in turn, create a euphoria to which users quickly develop a tolerance. Only higher dosages and more frequent use can bring about the same effect.
                                </p><p>
                                Today, cocaine is a worldwide, multibillion-dollar enterprise. Users encompass all ages, occupations and economic levels, even schoolchildren as young as eight years old.
                                    </p><p class="alert-info">
                                Cocaine use can lead to death from respiratory (breathing) failure, stroke, cerebral hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain) or heart attack. Children of cocaine-addicted mothers come into the world as addicts themselves. Many suffer birth defects and many other problems.

                                Despite its dangers, cocaine use continues to increase—likely because users find it so difficult to escape from the first steps taken down the long dark road that leads to addiction.

                                <p class="alert-info">
                                Crack cocaine is the crystal form of cocaine, which normally comes in a powder form.1 It comes in solid blocks or crystals varying in color from yellow to pale rose or white.
                                </p><p>
                                Crack is heated and smoked. It is so named because it makes a cracking or popping sound when heated.

                                Crack, the most potent form in which cocaine appears, is also the riskiest. It is between 75% and 100% pure, far stronger and more potent than regular cocaine.
                                    </p><p class="alert-danger">
                                Smoking crack allows it to reach the brain more quickly and thus brings an intense and immediate—but very short-lived—high that lasts about fifteen minutes. And because addiction can develop even more rapidly if the substance is smoked rather than snorted (taken in through the nose), an abuser can become addicted after his or her first time trying crack.
                                </p><p class="alert-info">

                                Because of cocaine’s high cost, it has long been considered a “rich man’s drug.” Crack, on the other hand, is sold at prices so low that even teens can afford to buy it—at first. The truth is that once a person is addicted, the expense skyrockets in direct ratio to the increasing amount needed to support the habit.

                                Methamphetamine is a white crystalline drug that people take by snorting it (inhaling through the nose), smoking it or injecting it with a needle. Some even take it orally, but all develop a strong desire to continue using it because the drug creates a false sense of happiness and well-being—a rush (strong feeling) of confidence, hyperactiveness and energy. One also experiences decreased appetite. These drug effects generally last from six to eight hours, but can last up to twenty-four hours.

                                Methamphetamine is an illegal drug in the same class as cocaine and other powerful street drugs. It has many nicknames—meth, crank, chalk or speed being the most common. (See the list of street names.)

                                Crystal meth is used by individuals of all ages, but is most commonly used as a “club drug,” taken while partying in night clubs or at rave parties. Its most common street names are ice or glass.

                                It is a dangerous and potent chemical and, as with all drugs, a poison that first acts as a stimulant but then begins to systematically destroy the body.

                                “Inhalants” refers to the vapors from toxic substances which are inhaled to reach a quick high. Of more than 1,000 household and other common products that could be abused as inhalants, most often used are shoe polish, glue, toluene,1 gasoline, lighter fluid, nitrous oxide2 or “whippets,” spray paint, correction fluid, cleaning fluid, amyl nitrite3 or “poppers,” locker room deodorizers or “rush,” and lacquer thinner or other paint solvents.
                                Most of these produce effects similar to anesthetics, which slow down the body’s functions. After an initial high and loss of inhibition comes drowsiness, light-headedness and agitation.

                                <p class="alert-danger">
                                The chemicals are rapidly absorbed through the lungs into the bloodstream and quickly reach the brain and other organs, sometimes causing irreversible physical and mental damage.

                                Users inhale the chemical vapors directly from open containers (“sniffing”) or breathe the fumes from rags soaked in chemicals (“huffing”). Some spray the substance directly into the nose or mouth, or pour it onto their collar, sleeves or cuffs and sniff them periodically. In “bagging,” the user may inhale fumes from substances inside a paper or plastic bag. Bagging in a closed area greatly increases the chances of suffocation.

                                Ecstasy is illegal. The Drug Enforcement Administration classifies it as a Schedule I drug, a description reserved for dangerous substances with no recognized medical use. Other Schedule I drugs include heroin and LSD. Penalties for possession, delivery and manufacturing of Ecstasy can include jail sentences of four years to life, and fines from $250,000 to $4 million, depending on the amount of the drug you have in your possession.

                                Tragically, Ecstasy is one of the most popular drugs among youth today. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimates Ecstasy users to number approximately 9 million worldwide. The vast majority of users are teenagers and young adults.
